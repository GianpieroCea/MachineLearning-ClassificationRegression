# MachineLearning-ClassificationRegression
Assignment done for the CS342 Machine Learning module at Warwick University. 

The Assignment was called "Plant vs Animals", the full specification of the assignment can be seen at the file "cs342_ass1.pdf", which is suggested to be read in order to underdstand the problem.

The Goal of this project was to get proficient at using the basic python stack for data science and machine learning (numpy,pandas,sklearn etc) to perform some basic regression and classification of some corrupt data (this was unkown at the beginning).

By working through this project I was able ,among other things, to learn the theory and the practice of:
- Basic data exploration and visualisation
- Preprocessing and data cleaning
- Hyperparameteres optimization via grid search
- Feature Selection
- Classification algorithms:
    - kNN algorithm
    - Decision Tree classifier
- Regression algorithms
  - Linear regression
  - Ridge regression
  - Lasso regression
  - Decision Tree regression
- Test set validation/ Cross validation
  
  
  The file 'answer.pdf' contains my final solution and my working of the best models and parameters while the files 'predictClass.py' and 'predictTNA.py' are the actual submitted files for the assignment.
 
 Much of the preparation work can be seen in the jupyter notebook 'Assignment1_2.ipnyb' (THIS NEED CLEANING,VERY ROUGH CODE)
  
I have also uploaded my feedback for the project in the '1325458.txt' file.
