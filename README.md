# MachineLearning-ClassificationRegression
Assignment done for the CS342 Machine Learning module at Warwick University. 

The Assignment was called "Plant vs Animals", the full specification of the assignment can be seen at the file "cs342_ass1.pdf", which is suggested to be read in order to underdstand the problem.

The Goal of this project was to get proficient at using the basic python stack for data science and machine learning (numpy,pandas,sklearn etc) to perform some basic regression and classification of some corrupt data (this was unkown at the beginning).

By working through this project I was able ,among other things, of learning the theory and the preactice of:
- Basic data exploration and visualisation
- Preprocessing and data cleaning
- Hyperparemteres optimization via grid search
- Feature Selection
- Classification algorithms:
    - kNN algorithm
    - Decision Tree classifier
- Regression algorithms
  - Linear regression
  - Ridge regression
  - Lasso regression
  - Decision Tree regression
- Test set valiation/ Cross validation
  
  
  The file answer.pdf contains my final solution and my working of the best models and parameters.
